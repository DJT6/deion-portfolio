        The Healthcare Appointment Booking System is a cloud-based web application that allows patients to book, cancel, and manage appointments with doctors. The backend runs on a single EC2 instance in a VPC, with application logs and metrics captured in CloudWatch. Data is stored using DynamoDB free tier (or SQLite for demo purposes), keeping costs low while maintaining a realistic multi-tier structure. The frontend is delivered through S3 and CloudFront for fast global access. Security is managed with IAM role-based access, security groups, and encryption of data in transit and at rest. Infrastructure is organized into public and private subnets to reflect real-world best practices, even though some services are simplified for free-tier usage. CI/CD is handled with a lightweight pipeline for fast updates, and the system design mirrors enterprise practices such as load balancing, auto scaling, and RDS Multi-AZ, which can be adopted in production. The demo emphasizes cost optimization while still demonstrating how reliability, scalability, and security are achieved in a modern cloud environment.
