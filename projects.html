      <h2>Containerized Threat Detection & Response Platform</h2>
      <p>
        A scalable, containerized security detection pipeline designed to identify and respond to suspicious activity in real time with near-zero idle cost. Logs are ingested, processed, and analyzed through a lightweight Kubernetes stack, triggering alerts and automated blocking when anomalies are detected. This project showcases container orchestration, real-time security response, and cost-optimized infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong> S3 (log ingestion) • SQS (buffering) • EC2 (K3s Kubernetes cluster) • Docker (services) • Fluent Bit (log ingestion) • Python ML service (anomaly detection) • SNS (alerting) • WAF (response automation) • Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring) • GitHub Actions + Terraform

      <h2>AI Log Detection and Response System</h2>
      <p>
        A fully serverless, ML-driven detection pipeline built to process and analyze security logs in real time. Leveraging SageMaker for anomaly detection, the system triggers alerts and automated blocking with no permanent infrastructure. This project highlights strong operational automation, security integration, and pay-per-use cost efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong> S3 (log storage) • Kinesis Firehose (streaming) • Lambda (preprocessing) • SageMaker (anomaly detection) • SNS (alerts) • WAF (response) • CloudWatch (monitoring) • GitHub Actions + Terraform

      <h2>Cloud-Based Appointment Management System</h2>
      <p>
        A production-grade appointment booking platform showcasing a secure and scalable AWS stack. It integrates authentication, monitoring, cost control, and automated CI/CD deployments. Designed for high availability, zero idle cost, and fast recovery, it reflects best practices for real-world, business-critical applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong> S3 + CloudFront (HTTPS) • API Gateway + Lambda (Node.js) • DynamoDB (conditional writes) • Cognito (auth) • CloudWatch (logs, alarms) • WAF + KMS • GitHub Actions + Terraform

      <h2>Cloud Game Leaderboard</h2>
      <p>
        A real-time serverless leaderboard that allows players to submit scores and view rankings through low-latency APIs. It integrates abuse detection and traffic control, ensuring stable performance at scale. This project emphasizes event-driven architecture, DynamoDB optimization, and operational monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Architecture:</strong> S3 (static frontend) • API Gateway (REST + WebSocket) • Lambda (Node.js) • DynamoDB (GSI for top-N rankings) • CloudWatch (monitoring & alarms) • WAF (rate limiting) • GitHub Actions + Terraform
